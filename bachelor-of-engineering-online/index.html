<p>
  Support services play a crucial role in the success of online engineering programs. These services provide students with the assistance they need to overcome challenges, stay on track, and achieve their academic goals. Academic advising helps students develop a personalized study plan, select courses, and navigate the academic requirements of the program. Technical assistance provides support with software, hardware, and other technical issues that students may encounter while completing their coursework online. Career counseling helps students explore career options, develop job search strategies, and prepare for the job market.
</p>
<p>
  The availability of these support services is particularly important for online engineering students who may not have the same access to resources and support as traditional on-campus students. For example, online students may not have access to a dedicated academic advisor or technical support staff on a regular basis. Support services can help to bridge this gap and ensure that online students have the resources they need to succeed.
</p>
<p>
  In addition to providing students with the assistance they need to succeed in their coursework, support services can also help to create a sense of community among online learners. By participating in online forums, discussion boards, and other social activities, students can connect with their peers and build relationships with other members of the online learning community. This sense of community can help to motivate students and make the online learning experience more enjoyable.
