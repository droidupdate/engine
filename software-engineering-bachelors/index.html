<h3>
  Testing and Quality Assurance
</h3>
<p>
  Testing and quality assurance (QA) are essential components of software engineering. They help to ensure that software is reliable, efficient, and meets the needs of users. There are many different types of testing and QA activities, but three of the most important are unit testing, integration testing, and system testing.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Unit testing</strong><br />
    <p>
      Unit testing is the process of testing individual units of code, such as functions or classes. Unit tests are typically written by the developers who wrote the code, and they are used to verify that the code is working as expected. Unit testing can help to identify and fix bugs early in the development process, before they can cause problems in the larger system.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Integration testing</strong><br />
    <p>
      Integration testing is the process of testing how different units of code work together. Integration tests are typically written by QA engineers, and they are used to verify that the different parts of a system are working together as expected. Integration testing can help to identify and fix bugs that would not be found during unit testing.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>System testing</strong><br />
    <p>
      System testing is the process of testing a complete software system. System tests are typically written by QA engineers, and they are used to verify that the system is working as expected in a real-world environment. System testing can help to identify and fix bugs that would not be found during unit or integration testing.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Testing and QA are essential for developing high-quality software. By learning about testing and QA techniques, software engineering students can prepare themselves for a successful career in the field.
</p>
<h3>
  Software Engineering Tools
