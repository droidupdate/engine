</p>
<p>
  If you want to search for an exact phrase, put it in quotation marks. For example, if you are looking for informacin about the "Mona Lisa," you would search for "Mona Lisa."
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Tip 3: Use filters to narrow your search results.</strong>
</p>
<p>
  Most search engine apps allow you to filter your search results by date, file type, and other criteria. This can be a helpful way to narrow down your results and find what you are looking for more quickly.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Tip 4: Use the advanced search features.</strong>
</p>
<p>
  Most search engine apps offer advanced search features that allow you to search for specific types of content, such as images, videos, or news articles. You can also use the advanced search features to search for content in specific languages or from specific websites.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Tip 5: Evaluate your search results critically.</strong>
</p>
<p>
  Not all search results are created equal. When you are evaluating your search results, it is important to consider the source of the information, the date it was published, and the author's credentials. You should also be aware of any biases that may be present in the information.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Summary:</strong>
</p>
<p>
  By following these tips, you can use search engine apps more effectively and efficiently. Remember to use specific keywords, use quotation marks to search for exact phrases, use filters to narrow your search results, use the advanced search features, and evaluate your search results critically.
