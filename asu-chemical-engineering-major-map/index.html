<h3>
  Prerequisites
</h3>
<p>
  Prerequisites are an essential part of the ASU chemical engineering major map. They ensure that students have the necessary knowledge and skills to succeed in their coursework. Prerequisites are typically listed in the course catalog and on the course syllabus. Students who do not have the necessary prerequisites may be dropped from the course or may struggle to keep up with the material.
</p>
<p>
  There are a number of reasons why prerequisites are important. First, they help to ensure that students have the necessary foundation for success in their coursework. For example, students who have not taken a course in general chemistry will not be able to succeed in a course in organic chemistry. Second, prerequisites help to prevent students from taking courses out of order. This can be important for courses that build on each other, such as the calculus sequence. Third, prerequisites help to ensure that students are taking courses that are appropriate for their level of study. For example, a freshman should not be taking a graduate-level course.
</p>
<p>
  The ASU chemical engineering major map includes a list of all of the prerequisites for each course. Students should carefully review the prerequisites before registering for courses. Students who have any questions about prerequisites should contact their academic advisor.

</p>
<p>
  There are a number of reasons why corequisites are important. First, they help to ensure that students have the necessary foundation for success in their coursework. For example, students who are taking a course in organic chemistry may also need to take a course in general chemistry as a corequisite. This is because the material in the organic chemistry course builds on the material in the general chemistry course. Second, corequisites help to prevent students from taking courses out of order. This can be important for courses that build on each other, such as the calculus sequence. Third, corequisites help to ensure that students are taking courses that are appropriate for their level of study. For example, a freshman should not be taking a graduate-level course.
</p>
<p>
  The ASU chemical engineering major map includes a list of all of the corequisites for each course. Students should carefully review the corequisites before registering for courses. Students who have any questions about corequisites should contact their academic advisor.

    <strong>Exploration of different fields:</strong> Elective courses allow students to explore different fields of study and learn about new topics. This can be helpful for students who are undecided about their career path or who want to gain a broader understanding of the world around them.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Preparation for specific careers:</strong> Elective courses can also be used to prepare for specific careers. For example, students who are interested in working in the environmental field can take elective courses in environmental science, environmental engineering, and sustainability.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Development of transferable skills:</strong> Elective courses can also help students to develop transferable skills, such as critical thinking, problem solving, and communication. These skills are valuable in any career field.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Personal enrichment:</strong> Elective courses can also be taken for personal enrichment. Students can take courses in areas that they are passionate about, such as art, music, or literature.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Elective courses are an important part of the ASU chemical engineering major map. They allow students to tailor their education to their interests and career goals. Elective courses can also be used to develop transferable skills and for personal enrichment.
