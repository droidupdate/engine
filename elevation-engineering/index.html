  Land use planning
</h3>
<p>
  Land use planning is the process of regulating the use of land in a community. It is a critical component of elevation engineering because it can be used to reduce the risk of flooding.
</p>
<p>
  One way that land use planning can be used to reduce the risk of flooding is by restricting development in floodplains. Floodplains are areas of land that are at risk of flooding. By restricting development in floodplains, communities can reduce the number of people and property that are at risk of flooding.
</p>
<p>
  Another way that land use planning can be used to reduce the risk of flooding is by requiring that new development be elevated above the base flood elevation. The base flood elevation is the elevation that has a 1% chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year. By requiring that new development be elevated above the base flood elevation, communities can reduce the risk of flooding damage.
