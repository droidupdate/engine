</p>
<h3>
  Holistic
</h3>
<p>
  Systems engineering is an interdisciplinary field that focuses on the design, integration, and management of complex systems. A key aspect of systems engineering is the holistic approach, which considers the entire system rather than just its individual components. This approach is essential for ensuring that all of the system's components work together effectively and that the system meets the needs of its users.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Understanding the big picture:</strong> Systems engineers need to have a clear understanding of the big picture in order to design and develop effective systems. This includes understanding the system's purpose, its users, and its environment.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Considering all of the interactions:</strong> Systems engineers need to consider all of the interactions between the different components of the system. This includes understanding how the components will affect each other and how the system will interact with its environment.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Optimizing the system as a whole:</strong> Systems engineers need to optimize the system as a whole, rather than just its individual components. This means making trade-offs between different design choices in order to achieve the best overall performance.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Managing complexity:</strong> Systems engineering is essential for managing the complexity of modern systems. By taking a holistic approach, systems engineers can reduce the risk of errors and ensure that the system meets its requirements.
  </li>
