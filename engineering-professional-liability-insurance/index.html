This is important because it allows engineers to focus on their work and provide the best possible service to their clients, without being burdened by the worry of potential lawsuits.
</p>
<p>
  For example, if an engineer makes a mistake that results in a financial loss for a client, the client may sue the engineer for damages. Without EPLI, the engineer would be personally liable for these damages, which could potentially bankrupt the engineer and put their business at risk.
</p>
<p>
  However, with EPLI, the engineer's insurance company would be responsible for paying the damages, which would allow the engineer to continue to provide services to their clients without fear of financial ruin.
