<ul>
  <li>One agency used data to identify a new target keyword that was driving a lot of traffic to a competitor's website. By optimizing their client's website for this keyword, the agency was able to increase their client's website traffic by 20%.
  </li>
  <li>Another agency used data to track the performance of their client's ad campaign. They discovered that one of the ads was not performing as well as the others. By pausing this ad, the agency was able to improve the overall performance of the campaign.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  These are just a few examples of how data can be used to improve search engine marketing campaigns. By choosing a data-driven search engine marketing agency, you can be sure that your campaigns are in good hands and that you are getting the best possible results.
