</p>
<h3>
  Outcomes-based
</h3>
<p>
  The rise of outcomes-based pricing models in software engineer bootcamps is a significant development that is making education more accessible and affordable for students. By only paying if they get a job, students can reduce the financial risk associated with attending a bootcamp. This is especially important for students who come from disadvantaged backgrounds or who have other financial commitments.
</p>
<p>
  Outcomes-based pricing models also align the incentives of bootcamps and students. Bootcamps have a vested interest in ensuring that their students are successful in finding jobs, as this is how they get paid. This alignment of interests helps to ensure that bootcamps are providing high-quality education and support services to their students.
</p>
<p>
  There are a number of different outcomes-based pricing models that bootcamps use. Some bootcamps charge a flat fee if the student gets a job within a certain period of time after graduating. Other bootcamps charge a percentage of the student's salary for a period of time.
</p>
<p>
  The outcomes-based pricing model is a major innovation in the education industry. It is making education more accessible and affordable for students, and it is also aligning the incentives of bootcamps and students. As a result, outcomes-based pricing models are likely to become increasingly common in the future.
