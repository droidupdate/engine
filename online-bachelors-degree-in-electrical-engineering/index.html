</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Lower tuition costs:</strong> Online programs often have lower tuition costs than traditional on-campus programs. This is because online programs do not have the same overhead costs as traditional on-campus programs, such as the cost of maintaining a physical campus and paying for faculty and staff.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>No commuting costs:</strong> Online students do not have to commute to campus, which can save them money on gas, parking, and other transportation costs.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Flexible scheduling:</strong> Online students can study at their own pace and on their own schedule, which can allow them to work and earn money while they are completing their degree.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Scholarships and financial aid:</strong> Online students are eligible for the same scholarships and financial aid as traditional on-campus students. This can help to further reduce the cost of their education.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  The affordability of online bachelor's degrees in electrical engineering makes them a great option for students who are looking to save money on their education. By choosing an online program, students can get the same high-quality education as they would in a traditional on-campus program, but at a lower cost.
</p>
<h3>
  Time savings
</h3>
<p>
  Online bachelor's degrees in electrical engineering can be completed in a shorter amount of time than traditional on-campus programs. This is due to several factors:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
